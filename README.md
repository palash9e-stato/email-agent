**Email Replying Agent**


This workflow checks your Gmail inbox for unread emails, pulls in the full message details, and sends them to a Gemini AI agent that writes a clear, professional reply based on the email’s subject and content. The generated reply, along with the original email body and sender information, is then saved into Airtable for easy tracking and review. It’s a simple, automated system designed to help you manage inbox tasks more efficiently by combining email reading, AI-powered drafting, and database logging inside n8n.
